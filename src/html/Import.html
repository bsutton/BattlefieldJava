Importing a Ruler<br>
Once you have developed you ruler you need to import it into the
Battlefield Java game simulator and run it.<br>
      <br>
Start by adding you Ruler class (and any others you have created) to
the classpath. You can do this by copying them to the 'ext' directory
under the Battlefield Java install directory.<br>
Launch Battlefield Java and and click either the 'Run' or 'Step'
button, the Add ruler dialog is displayed.<br>
Click the 'Import' button and enter the fully qualified class name of
your ruler.<br>
      <br>
You only need to import your ruler once. <br>
Import any other rulers that you want to do battle with.<br>
      <br>
Note: currenlty there is no way to delete a ruler via tahe UI once it
has been imported. You can however delete a ruler by editing the
Ruler.xml file.<br>
