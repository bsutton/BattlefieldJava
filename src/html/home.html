      <h1>Battlefield Java</h1>

Battlefield Java is an adaption of the original idea behind 'CodeRuler'
by Tim DeBoer. Battlefield Java is a turn based battle simulation game
with a difference. The difference is that you need to be a Java
Programmer (or at least a budding one) to play. The battle simulations
is designed to pit the abilities of two or more Java Programmers to
create an intelligent program which guides the movements of the players
pieces during the battle. <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Why Battlefield Java</h2>
After downloading and playing with CodeRuler I was impressed with the
simplicity of the concept. I had&nbsp; been looking for a platform
on which I could explore some ideas I had for combining Genetic
programming with Neural networks. CodeRuler looked perfect, however
after some experimentation I found CodeRuler difficult to program
with. The problem wasn't with the API, which is quite simple to use,
but rather with the development/test environment. The CodeRuler
interface is designed to look pretty (something which Battlefield Java
can never be accused of ;), and to provide a runtime environment.
However CodeRuler (at least in my opinion) seriously lacked any useful
development and testing tools (despite integration with Eclipse). The
second issue was that it isn't open source, so it was impossible to
amend. I don't intend these comments to detract in anyway from the work
which Tim DeBoer has done, Battlefield Java is simply intended to
continue on from the great ideas that began with CodeRuler.<br>
The primary aims of Battlefield Java are therefore to create a battle
simulator which is backwards compatible with CodeRuler (with the
exception of the package names) but which provides an improved
development and test environment.<br>
