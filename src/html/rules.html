      <h1>The Rules</h1>
The Battlefield consists of a two dimensional&nbsp; grid&nbsp;
apon which the players move their pieces. Each player is refererred to
as a <br>
Ruler. The game utilises only three types of pieces; Castles, Knights
and Peasants. Castles are fixed position pieces which occupy a single
location on the grid. The Castles generate additional Peasants and
Knights (referred to as Subjects) as the game progresses. Normally each
Ruler starts with a single Castle on the board and a number of Peasants
and Knights. The game is played across a number of rounds; during each
round each Ruler is given a turn during which he may move each of his
Subjects. Subjects may only move one place during each round to any one
of the eight
adjacent locations, providing the location is not already occupied. As
Peasants are moved they capture each location on the grid through which
they move. As Knights move they have the ability to attack the pieces
of the other rulers. A Knight may either move or attack in a single
round but not both. A Knight may only attack a piece which occupies one
of the locations adjacent to the Knight. When a Knight attacks a piece,
the attack reduces the Strength of the attacked piece by a random
amount (between 15 and 30), if the piece's strength drops below zero
then the piece is killed or in the case of&nbsp; a Castle captured.
When a Knight captures or kills a piece the Knights strength increases
by 20. At the start of each round each Ruler's Castle may generate
additional Peasants or Knights. The number of Subjects created is
dependant on the number of locations owned by the Ruler. The Ruler
scores each time a location or piece is captured.<br>
      <br>
That is the complete set of rules to the game and as such Battlefield
Java is very simple to learn. The hard bit is to design a Ruler which
operates within the set of rules more successfully than anyone elses
Ruler, as measured by the final score.<br>
